# Installation

We provide three different ways to install reveal.js depending on your use case and technical experience.

- The basic setup is the easiest way to get started. No need to set up any build tools.
- The full setup gives you access to the build tools needed to make changes to the reveal.js source code. It includes a web server which is required if you want to load external Markdown files (the basic setup paired with your own choice of local web server works too).
- If you want to use reveal.js as a dependency in your project, you can install from npm.

# Next Steps

Once reveal.js is installed, we recommend checking out the Markup and Config Option guides.

## Basic Setup

We make a point of distributing reveal.js in a way that it can be used by as many people as possible. The basic setup is our most broadly accessible way to get started and only requires that you have a web browser. There's no need to go through a build process or install any dependencies.

1. Download the latest reveal.js version from [My depo](https://github.com/krxdow/Presentation-salary-prediction/archive/refs/heads/master.zip)
2. Unzip and replace the example contents in index.html with your own
3. Open index.html in a browser to view it

That's it ðŸš€

## Full Setup - Recommended

Some reveal.js features, like external Markdown, require that presentations run from a local web server. The following instructions will set up such a server as well as all of the development tasks needed to make edits to the reveal.js source code.

1. Install Node.js (10.0.0 or later)
2. Clone the reveal.js repository: `$ git clone https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js.git`
3. Move to the reveal.js folder and install dependencies: `$ cd reveal.js && npm install`
4. Serve the presentation and monitor source files for changes: `$ npm start`
5. Open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) to view your presentation
